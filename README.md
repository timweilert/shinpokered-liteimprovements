Based on https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered

I wanted to use the lite branch, but implement some custom features for increased quality of life while maintaining a mostly vanilla experience.


Changes:
- Enabled running shoes
- Set player money to initialize at $50,000
- Make the Viridian Pokemart stock EXP_ALL to allow for early game use.
